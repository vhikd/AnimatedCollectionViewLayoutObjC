# AnimatedCollectionViewLayoutObjC
Normally a `UICollectionView` has no transition effects when you scroll from one item to another. There are lots of ways to write animations for UICollectionView, but using a UICollectionViewLayout subclass is by far the simplest one. And it doesn't break any of your existing code. You can still use your UICollectionView subclass and you don't need to change your UICollectionViewCell. Just plug and enjoy.
